Quiz Flow with Gamification - Web Application
Project Overview
This web-based quiz application allows users to take a quiz with multiple-choice questions fetched from an API. The application integrates gamification elements to make the quiz-taking experience more engaging and interactive. Users can start the quiz, answer questions, and view a summary of their results at the end, with a score based on their performance.
